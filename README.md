**Running Instructions :**

To run the project follow these steps:
```
To check the statistics by counting events by type, run the count_by_event_type.py script.
To check the statistics by counting words, run the count_words.py script.
```

**Flow Scripts Short Description :**

**Producer Script:**
```
This script provides a way to simulate the generation of events based on configurations provided in a JSON file.
 It continuously generates events with random types and data, with occasional random data generation, and introduces random delays between event batches.
```

**Consumer Script:**

```
This script asynchronously consumes events generated by producer.py, processes them, and prints information about each event.
 It utilizes asyncio to manage asynchronous execution and subprocess creation, making it suitable for scenarios where event consumption needs to be non-blocking and concurrent.
```
**Event Processor Script :**
```
This script provides a class-based solution to consume events from a subprocess, process them, and generate statistics on event types and word appearances.
 It uses Counter objects to efficiently count occurrences and provides methods to retrieve the statistics in JSON format.
```

**Interface Script :**
```
This script creates a web API using Flask to expose event statistics generated by an EventProcessor class.
 It provides endpoints to retrieve event counts by type and word appearances, making the statistics accessible over HTTP.
```
**Count By Event Type Script :**
```
This script acts as a client to fetch event statistics from a Flask API endpoint and handles the response accordingly.
 It ensures the Flask app is started, makes the request, processes the response, and terminates the Flask app process upon completion.
```

**Count Words Script :**
```
This script acts as a client to fetch word appearance data from a Flask API endpoint.
 It ensures the Flask app is started, makes the request, processes the response, and terminates the Flask app process after completing the request.
```

**Three Improvements :**
```
1.Error Handling - Implement more robust error handling mechanisms in the scripts to handle various edge cases and exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages.

2.Optimization - Optimize code where possible for better performance, such as minimizing unnecessary computations, reducing redundant code, and improving algorithm efficiency.
 Additionally, consider optimizing resource usage, especially in long-running processes, to minimize memory and CPU utilization.

3.Documentation - Enhance documentation across the project, including inline comments, docstrings, and README updates, to provide comprehensive guidance on usage, setup, and maintenance of the scripts.
